# FTC_Master_SkyStone
This is team 9415 Wrench Dressing's repository for the challenge this year, Skystone. To better navigate this, the things labelled template are templates for tele-op and autonomous modes respectively. I, Jake, have labelled my code under names that include jake.java. This is still a work in progress and will be updated, and I am new to this so hopefully this helps. I have tried to best label updates and specific patches, although I skipped quite a few. Hopefully this will assist the next generation of Wrench Dressing coders and give them a head start.


Get Boofed Idiot!!!
